Three build scripts are provided

fsl-setup-release.sh 
Used for initializing the Yocto Project build environment for i.MX BSP releases
using the meta-fsl-bsp-release layer.  This script calls setup-environment.

release_all_build.sh
Used to build our release images to show how i.MX release images are created.
This builds imx6qdlsolo which is a rootfs that can be used for imx6q, imx6dl and imx6solo.
The second rootfs imx6slevk is built to show a non-VPU rootfs.

backend_consolidated.sh
Used to build non-X11 builds for DirectFB, Framebuffer and wayland.  This script was used
to create the release images.
